I would like to thank all the backers who supported the launch of this project.
The people listed below all backed my Kickstarter project allowing me to produce a production run.

With out their support this would have remained a small hobby project.

I hope that everyone enjoys this shield and look forward to seeing all the projects people create using them.

Names to be listed soon.... (once the final surveys are in)
